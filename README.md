## 1. Overview

Using an ESP32 board with MicroPython automated the process of sending emails using an SMTP server. As an example, sending notifications by e-mail when sensors are triggered is implemented. It's easy to use and you can receive realtime alterts in all your projects. To send e-mails using MicroPython, the [uMail](https://github.com/shawwwn/uMail) module is used. This module is not part of the MicroPython library, so it needs to be downloaded.

## 2. Obtaining a free SMTP service for sending email
I strongly recommend creating a new e-mail account from which the newsletter will be sent. If something goes wrong and you get banned, it won't be your main email address :blush:  
This newly created account must be used when registering on the SMTP mailing service.  
After creating the sender email, the next step is to get the SMTP email server settings. I haven't been able to get them through Gmail yet.
Therefore, after a short wandering, the choice settled on the following services, taking into account the availability of a free option:  
[Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/). Its free use allows you to send 100 letters per day.  
[Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/). Its free use allows you to send 300 letters per day.
All of them require verification during registration by sending an SMS message code to the phone number you specified. When registering, you should specify the new e-mail that was created for sending messages.

## 3. Install
Copy the code to your project.
